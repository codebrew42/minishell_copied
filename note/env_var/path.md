## Absolute and Relative Paths

- **Absolute Path:** This is a path that specifies the location of a file or directory from the root directory. It always starts with the root directory, which is denoted by `/` in Unix-like systems. For example, `/home/user/documents` is an absolute path.

- **Relative Path:** This is a path that specifies the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory. It does not start with `/`. For example, if your current directory is `/home/user`, then `documents` or `./documents` would be a relative path to the `documents` directory.
