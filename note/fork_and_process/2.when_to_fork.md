# When to Fork in Minishell

For 42's Minishell project, you should not fork for **external commands(=executable)** and **two built-ins (echo, env)** that don't modify the shell's state.
## Which Built-ins Should Run in the Parent Shell?

These commands modify the parent shell's state, so they must run without forking:

- **cd** → Changes the working directory
- **export** → Sets environment variables
- **unset** → Removes environment variables
- **exit** → Exits the shell
- **pwd** → Prints working directory (technically can fork, but better to avoid it)

## Which Commands Should Fork?

- Any external commands(=executable) (e.g., `/bin/ls`, `/usr/bin/grep`, etc.)
- Two Built-ins that don't modify the shell's state:
  - **echo**
  - **env**

## How to Implement in Minishell?

When executing a command:

1. Check if it's a built-in:
   - If yes → Execute in the parent shell (without `fork()`).
   - If no → Fork a child process and use `execve()`.

### Example Execution Flow in C

```c
if (is_builtin(command)) {
    execute_builtin(command);  // Run directly in the parent
} else {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) { // Child process
        execve(command, args, envp);
        exit(1); // Exit if execve fails
    } else if (pid > 0) { // Parent process
        waitpid(pid, &g_status, 0);
    }
}
```

## When to Use `fork()` in Minishell

To handle command execution properly, `fork()` should be used **before calling `execve()`**. This allows the child process to replace itself with the command using `execve()`, while the parent process continues accepting user input.

### Key Points:

1. **Fork before executing** → `fork()` should always be done **before `execve()`**.
2. **Handle file descriptors** → Use `dup2()` for redirections and close unnecessary file descriptors.
3. **Use pipes efficiently** → If a command is followed by a pipe (`|`), create a pipe before forking.
4. **Parent process waits** → The parent process should wait for the child process to finish using `waitpid()`.

### The Last Step of Execution

- **Fork and Execute**:
  - Use `fork()` to create a child process.
  - In the child process, call `execve()` to execute the command.
  - The parent process waits for the child to finish using `waitpid()`.

### Example Code for Forking and Executing

```c
pid_t pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) // Child process
{
    execve(command_path, args, env);
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE); // If execve fails, exit the child process
}
else if (pid > 0) // Parent process
{
    waitpid(pid, &status, 0); // Wait for the child process to finish
}
else // Fork failed
{
    perror("fork failed");
}
```
