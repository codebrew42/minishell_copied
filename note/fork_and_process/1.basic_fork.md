# Forking in Minishell

## 1. What is Forking?
Forking is the process of creating a new process from an existing one. In Unix-based systems, the `fork()` system call is used to duplicate a process, creating a parent and a child process. The child process is a copy of the parent but has a unique process ID (PID). This is essential for executing commands in a shell without blocking the shell itself.

## 2. Why is Forking Important in Minishell?
In Minishell, forking is necessary to execute external commands. When a command is entered, the shell creates a new child process using `fork()`, allowing the shell to continue running while the command executes. Without forking, the shell would be blocked until the command finishes executing.

### Benefits of Forking:
- Enables concurrent execution of commands.
- Prevents the shell from being blocked by long-running commands.
- Ensures proper process isolation, keeping the shell stable.


## 5. Handling Pipes in Forking
If a command is part of a pipeline (`|`), a pipe must be created before forking.

### **Pipe Handling Process**
1. Before forking, create a pipe if the next token is `|`.
2. If the command has a previous pipe, duplicate its read end (`dup2()`).
3. If the command has a next pipe, duplicate its write end (`dup2()`).
4. Close unnecessary file descriptors after duplication.
5. Execute the command in the child process.
6. The parent process waits for the child.

### **Example Code for Pipes**
```c
int fd[2];
pipe(fd);
pid_t pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) // Child process
{
    dup2(fd[1], STDOUT_FILENO); // Redirect output to pipe
    close(fd[0]); // Close unused read end
    execve(cmd, args, env);
}
else // Parent process
{
    dup2(fd[0], STDIN_FILENO); // Redirect input from pipe
    close(fd[1]); // Close unused write end
    waitpid(pid, NULL, 0);
}
```

## 6. Managing File Descriptors
- **Close after `dup2()`**: After duplicating a file descriptor, close the original.
- **Handle redirections properly**: Ensure that output files are properly opened and replaced using `dup2()`.
